c-projects
==========

old assignments from Cs106x

These were my first attempts at C++ code using Qt as an editor. Within the build-* folder of every project you should be able to run the application and see what it does.

I can't find the build file for Life.cpp so that doesn't work for now.

Really I just wanted to keep track of my first C++ projects because I thought they were fun.
